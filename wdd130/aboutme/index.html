        <p>Hello and welcome to my about me page.
    My name is Seth, I am 23 years old and am from Utah. I got married last year to my wife Stephanie. We are both in school right now with her pursuing accounting, and I am pursuing an applied technology degree.  </p>
        <p>
        Overall I have a simple but good life and love being a member of the Church with my wife. I hope to be use this education provided through the church to be able to provide for my family and bless those around me.
        </p>
        <p>
        Those are my goals and hopes but a little extra about me is I love spending time with my family, video games, cooking, and art. I don't always get to do those with the time I have, but I do enjoy them all. Thank you for taking some time to learn about me. Have a good day!
